Name of server file: server.js (node server.js)

Port: 3000

Browser: Google Chrome

Note: I turned it in with the node_modules directory and the libs folder so the setup is unnessesary. Just 'node server.js' and go to localhost:3000.

Setup: Run npm install in the root directory and then run bower install. Npm start uses nodemon so you will need to run npm install -g nodemon for the npm start command to work. Otherwise just do "node server.js"
